<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>FILE_OBJECT</strong> structure is used by the system to represent a file object. To user-mode protected subsystems, a file object represents an open instance of a file, device, directory, or volume. To device and intermediate drivers, a file object usually represents a device object. To drivers in the file system stack, a file object usually represents a directory or file.</p>
<p>A file object is partially opaque. Certain types of drivers, such as file system drivers and network transport drivers, use some of the fields of file objects.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<h3><code>Type</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member used by the system to indicate that the object is a file object. If the object is a file object, the value of this member is 5.</p>
<h3><code>Size</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member that specifies the size, in bytes, of the file object. This size does not include the file object extension, if one is present.</p>
<h3><code>DeviceObject</code></h3>
<p>A pointer to the device object on which the file is opened.</p>
<h3><code>Vpb</code></h3>
<p>A pointer to the volume parameter block associated with the file object.</p>
<p>Note that if the <strong>Vpb</strong> member is non-<strong>NULL</strong>, the file resides on a mounted volume.</p>
<h3><code>FsContext</code></h3>
<p>A pointer to whatever optional state a driver maintains about the file object; otherwise, <strong>NULL</strong>. For file system drivers, this member must point to a <strong><a href="fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header" title="typedef struct _FSRTL_ADVANCED_FCB_HEADER {&#10;  FSRTL_COMMON_FCB_HEADER          DUMMYSTRUCTNAME;&#10;  PFAST_MUTEX                      FastMutex;&#10;  LIST_ENTRY                       FilterContexts;&#10;  EX_PUSH_LOCK                     PushLock;&#10;  PVOID                            *FileContextSupportPointer;&#10;  union {&#10;    OPLOCK Oplock;&#10;    PVOID  ReservedForRemote;&#10;  };&#10;  PVOID                            AePushLock;&#10;  PVOID                            ReservedContextLegacy;&#10;  ULONG                            BypassIoOpenCount;&#10;  struct _FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT *ReservedContext;&#10;} FSRTL_ADVANCED_FCB_HEADER;">FSRTL_ADVANCED_FCB_HEADER</a></strong> header structure that is contained within a file-system-specific structure; otherwise system instability can result. Usually, this header structure is embedded in a file control block (FCB). However, on some file systems that support multiple data streams, such as NTFS, this header structure is a stream control block (SCB).</p>
<p>In a WDM device stack, only the functional device object (FDO) can use the two context pointers. File system drivers share this member across multiple opens to the same data stream.</p>
<h3><code>FsContext2</code></h3>
<p>A pointer to whatever additional state a driver maintains about the file object; otherwise, <strong>NULL</strong>.</p>
<p>This member is opaque for drivers in the file system stack because the underlying file system utilizes this member.</p>
<h3><code>SectionObjectPointer</code></h3>
<p>A pointer to the file object's read-only section object. This member is set only by file systems and used for Cache Manager interaction.</p>
<h3><code>PrivateCacheMap</code></h3>
<p>An opaque member, set only by file systems, that points to handle-specific information and that is used for Cache Manager interaction.</p>
<h3><code>FinalStatus</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member that is used, in certain synchronous cases, to indicate the final status of the file object's I/O request.</p>
<h3><code>RelatedFileObject</code></h3>
<p>A pointer to a <strong>FILE_OBJECT</strong> structure used to indicate that the current file object has been opened relative to an already open file object. The file object pointed to by this member is usually a directory (meaning the current file has been opened relative to this directory). However, a file can be reopened relative to itself, and alternate data streams for a file can be opened relative to an already open primary data stream for that same file. The <strong>RelatedFileObject</strong> member is only valid during the processing of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/irp-mj-create">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a> requests.</p>
<h3><code>LockOperation</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, a lock operation (<strong><a href="ntlockfile" title="NTSYSCALLAPI&#10;NTSTATUS&#10;NTAPI&#10;NtLockFile(&#10;    _In_ HANDLE FileHandle,&#10;    _In_opt_ HANDLE Event,&#10;    _In_opt_ PIO_APC_ROUTINE ApcRoutine,&#10;    _In_opt_ PVOID ApcContext,&#10;    _Out_ PIO_STATUS_BLOCK IoStatusBlock,&#10;    _In_ PLARGE_INTEGER ByteOffset,&#10;    _In_ PLARGE_INTEGER Length,&#10;    _In_ ULONG Key,&#10;    _In_ BOOLEAN FailImmediately,&#10;    _In_ BOOLEAN ExclusiveLock&#10;    );">NtLockFile</a></strong>) has never been performed on the file object. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, at least one lock operation has been performed on the file object. Once set to <strong>TRUE</strong>, this member always remains <strong>TRUE</strong> (for example, releasing file locks on the file object does not reset this member to <strong>FALSE</strong>).</p>
<h3><code>DeletePending</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, a delete operation for the file associated with the file object exists. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, there currently is no pending delete operation for the file object.</p>
<h3><code>ReadAccess</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for read access. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, the file has been opened without read access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.</p>
<h3><code>WriteAccess</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for write access. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, the file has been opened without write access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.</p>
<h3><code>DeleteAccess</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for delete access. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, the file has been opened without delete access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.</p>
<h3><code>SharedRead</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for read sharing access. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, the file has been opened without read sharing access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.</p>
<h3><code>SharedWrite</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for write sharing access. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, the file has been opened without write sharing access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.</p>
<h3><code>SharedDelete</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member. If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for delete sharing access. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, the file has been opened without delete sharing access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.</p>
<h3><code>Flags</code></h3>
<p>A read-only member used by the system to hold one or more (a bitwise inclusive OR combination) of the following private flag values.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Drivers can use the <strong>FsContext</strong> and <strong>FsContext2</strong> members to maintain driver-determined state about an open file object.

<p>All remaining members in a file object are either opaque or read-only:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opaque members within a file object should be considered inaccessible. Drivers with dependencies on object field locations or access to opaque members might not remain portable and interoperable with other drivers over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drivers can use read-only members to acquire relevant information but must not modify read-only members and, if a pointer, the object that the member points to.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The type of object (for example, a file, directory, or volume) that a given file object represents cannot be determined by only examining the contents of the file object structure.
